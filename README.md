# Predator-Prey simulation

## Introduction 

The aim of the project is to partially reproduce the behevior of animals in nature. We focus our simulation around the social capabilities of animals. In other words, we allow agents in our simulation to organize their moves in groups of animals. For that purpose we desscoiate three types of groups :

- Familly made of a "father" (independent of his sex) who must bring back the needed food for the whole family, a "mother" who must protects children, and obviously the children. A family can be entirely made of herbivorous or carnivorous animals.
- Pack made of a chief who takes all the decision for the group and members of the pack. The pack is exclusively composed of carnivorous animals.
- Herd for herbivorous animals in which there is no hierarchy between members of the group.
